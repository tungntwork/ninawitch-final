    "p1": "Not every magical candle should be lit by ordinary hands. Certain rituals—if not performed at the right time and in the right way—can lose their direction or vanish midway.",
    "p2": "Therefore, for every ritual you entrust, NiNa will be the one to light the candles, draw circles, craft sigils, recite incantations, call forth names, and close the gates upon completion.",
    "p3": "You don't need to do anything except to sincerely believe and trust that these rituals already exist in your life.👉 You don’t need to strain yourself learning how to \"do it right.\"👉 All you need is to be present—in trust and quietness.👉 Leave the rest—to me.",
    "p4": "I am the keeper of the flame. I stand between you and the universe. Each ritual I perform on your behalf will be conducted with reverence—sacredness—and absolute privacy. 🎐"
