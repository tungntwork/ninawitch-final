    "p1": "The Art of Magic begins with the knowledge of one's self, so is one's own creation first of all works; it comprehends the others and is the beginning of the Great Work. Knowing Thyself is the toughest aspect of Magic, and the one which forces us to evolve.⁣",
    "p2": "When it comes to Magic, to creation your own reality, to ascending, to anything we want to achieve, THE VISIBLE is the manifestation of THE INVISIBLE, or, in other terms, the world, the way we see it, bears an exact proportion to the things which are inappreciable by our senses and unseen by our eyes.⁣"
