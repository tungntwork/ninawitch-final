  "title": "MAGIC GIFT By NiNawitch✨🍀🌳🧧🎁",
  "paragraph1": "This began from those few spontaneous nights when NiNa felt so much joy staying up to choose gifts for everyone on the Day of the God of Wealth.",
  "paragraph2": "NiNa is an art collector and a creator of her own unique artistic identity, so she owns many collectibles and handmade items—like an \"iconic supermarket\" filled with sacred and magical personal objects. These are curated and offered during powerful energetic times of the year. She has been through emotional and physical hardships herself, and deeply understands what it’s like to face those alone. The items under this category are random gifts she includes for customers during certain months. There is no fixed schedule—she simply wants to surprise everyone ^^",
  "paragraph3": "NiNa hopes these little charming gifts will bring comfort and accompany you in both joyful and difficult times. You can also purchase these items individually. The gifts are quite diverse, and NiNa might not always upload them here, so for the latest updates, check her personal Facebook stories.",
  "quote": "No one teaches you how to change your thoughts, to embrace the good after going through pain. But luck still exists, good people still exist, and a gentler life is waiting for you. Just let it all unfold.",
  "paragraph4": "💟 I hope this quote \"touches\" the hearts that are wounded and feeling dark in this life. Even if you feel like the entire universe is against you, believe that good people still exist somewhere. Even if it’s only a tiny 1% of belief—hold on to it. But before that arrives, you must first learn to believe in yourself..🌬️",
