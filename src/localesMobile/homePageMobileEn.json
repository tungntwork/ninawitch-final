  "mysteryHeader": "The Art of Magic⁣",
  "mysteryP1": "The word ART when reversed, or read after the manner of sacred characters from right to left, gives three initials which express the different division of the Great Work. T signifies triad, theory and travail; R, realization; A, adaptation. Art is CREATION.⁣",
  "mysteryP2": "Begins with the knowledge of one's self, so is one's own creation first of all works; it comprehends the others and is the beginning of the Great Work. Knowing Thyself is the toughest aspect of Magic, and the one which forces us to evolve.⁣",
  "mysteryP3": "When it comes to Magic, to creation your own reality, to ascending, to anything we want to achieve, THE VISIBLE is the manifestation of THE INVISIBLE, or, in other terms, the world, the way we see it, bears an exact proportion to the things which are inappreciable by our senses and unseen by our eyes.⁣",
  "mysteryP4": "When it comes to Magic, to creation your own reality, to ascending, to anything we want to achieve, <span class='font-lemajor'>The Visible</span> is the manifestation of <span class='font-lemajor'>The Invisible</span>, or, in other terms, the world, the way we see it, bears an exact proportion to the things which are inappreciable by our senses and unseen by our eyes.⁣",
  "mysteryP5": "Magic is unwritten science, which represents the idea of learning by intuition. We must be prodigal in seeking things out, have faith in ourselves like no one else and keep going where others failed. ⁣",
  "mysteryP6": "We must pursue our dreams with an untamed force of love, be happy for no reason, don’t be scared to make mistakes, and dare to be different, be yourself.⁣"
