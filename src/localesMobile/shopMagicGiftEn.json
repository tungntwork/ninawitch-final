    "This all started when NiNa felt genuine joy after a few spontaneous nights staying up late to pick out gifts for everyone on the Day of the God of Wealth.<br/><br/>NiNa is an art collector and creator of her own artistic expression, so she naturally owns a wide variety of collectibles and handmade items—like an \"iconic supermarket\" of sacred, magical personal objects. She maintains this collection and releases them during high-energy times of the year. Having gone through deep spiritual and physical struggles herself, she understands what it means to endure such things alone.<br/>The items listed in this category are random gifts that I give to customers on certain months. There’s no fixed schedule for this—I want it to be a surprise for everyone ^^<br/><br/>NiNa hopes that these little gifts will bring comfort and accompany you not only during joyful moments but also when life feels overwhelming.<br/>You can also purchase these items individually. The gifts vary quite a lot, and I may not always post them here—please check NiNa’s personal Facebook stories for the latest updates.",
    "\"No one teaches you how to change your thoughts,<br/>how to embrace the good things after you've<br/>been through the pain.<br/>But luck still exists. Good people still exist.<br/>And a gentler life is also waiting for you.<br/>Just let it all unfold.\"",
    "💟 I hope this quote \"reaches\" the hearts that are wounded and feel lost in this life. Even when you feel like the entire universe is against you, believe that somewhere, good people still exist. Even if it's just 1% of belief—hold on to it. But before that arrives, you must first learn to believe in yourself..🌬️",
