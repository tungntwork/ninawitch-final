    "Everything I'm doing is not aimed at fame or personal gain. The truth is, for a very long time, I haven't prioritized those things nor chased after them, because so many others in society already do. What I aim for is known only to myself. I've even planned for a certain day — a Day X — when I will erase everything about myself from social media.",
    "I don't want too many people to know about me or become too familiar with my existence. What remains might just be a feeling — an intense yet gentle sensation that travels from the ear to the brain — the way people pass stories by word of mouth, or perhaps a book I leave behind someday.",
    "When you grow old, you might vaguely remember that once, there was a girl like that who passed through your life's vision at a particular moment. She felt like she stepped out of a book, from the wind, from an idea — the strangest girl you've ever known, even if only online. You might wonder whether she was even real, but you'll believe that in this world, miracles do exist.",
    "If you resonate with my path and wish to support me more personally, we always welcome and deeply appreciate your contributions.",
    "If you're here, it means you’ve been following me on my social media platforms.",
    "I’m forever grateful to you.<br />Every time you watch a video, a short film, like, share, comment, follow me on social media, or book my services — you help grow my tiny empire more and more.<br />Everything I do, I do for you and because of you.",
    "Without you, there would be no me.<br />I have no permanent home — I move from place to place, guided by the calling of my heart and inner spirit.<br />I’ve been a pilgrim seeking magic and ancient wisdom for many years. Sometimes I feel lonely, but all I have to do is read your comments or realize you’re following and resonating with what I create and bring into the world. You have the power to touch my heart and give me your love and kindness, no matter where we are on this planet.<br />You always remind me that I’m never alone, and wherever I go, you are always with me.",
    "Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your love, your magic, your support, and your beauty.",
